ABSTRACT = {The reliability analysis of traction inverters is of great interest due to the use of new semi-conductor devices and inverter topologies in electric vehicles (EVs). Switching devices in the inverter are the most vulnerable component due to the electrical, thermal and mechanical stresses based on various driving conditions. Accurate stress analysis of power module is imperative for development of compact high-performance inverter designs with enhanced reliability. Therefore, this paper presents an inverter reliability estimation approach using an enhanced power loss model developed considering dynamic and transient influence of power semi-conductors. The temperature variation tracking has been improved by incorporating power module component parameters in an LPTN model of the inverter. A 100 kW EV grade traction inverter is used to validate the developed mathematical models towards estimating the inverter performance and subsequently, predicting the remaining useful lifetime of the inverter against two commonly used drive cycles.},
